 * VVersion - Incremented by the build every time the project is built

 * NOTE: Make sure to run the caller (the IDE / Visual Studio) as ADMIN if
 *       if your UCP is still enabled (Which, please god, turn it off)!
 * 
 * Also, this file is very FRAGILE! Do NOT ADD ANYTHING TO THIS FILE as it 
 * will most likely BREAK and you/we will LOSE the build revision number!
 * DO NOT ADD ANY PERIODS TO THIS FILE (notice all of these sentences end 
 * with an exclamation point)!!
